# s2v-iia-speech2text-demo
This is a prototype of using webkitSpeechRecognition to recognise speech and converts it into Text.

How this works:

1. Clone or Download the zip file
2. npm install
3. Start it: node app
4. Open Google Chrome and go to the indicated location - By default it is on http://localhost:3003
5. Click on the microphone
6. The first time Chrome will ask you to allow access to your microphone, do it.
7. Then talk at your microphone. When you are done, it will stop it and get the recognised speech in text from the Google Cloud.
8. The text will be presented in the same textfield with the microphone.


Now, imagine the possibilities!!!

Happy coding!
